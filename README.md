# MultiClass-Classification-Guide
In this notebook I will solve a multiclass classification problem with 10 targets. The goal for this notebook is to give a idea of the steps we need to follow to solve a multiclass classification problem. There's almost no data preprocessing since the dataset is very straight forward and doesnt have missing values.
